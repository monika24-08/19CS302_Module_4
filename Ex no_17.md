## DATE:23/11/2025
## AIM:
To write a C Program to compare two strings without using strcmp().

## Algorithm 
1.Start.
2.Define a variables.
3.Write program to compare two strings using nested for loop and if statement.
4.Read the value using scanf.
5.Ask the user to make an input.
6.Print out the answer.
7.End.

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 char str1[100], str2[100];
 int i = 0, flag = 0;
 scanf("%s", str1);
 scanf("%s", str2);
 while (str1[i] != '\0' || str2[i] != '\0') {
 if (str1[i] != str2[i]) {
 flag = 1;
 break;
 }
 i++; } 
if (flag == 0) 
printf("Strings are equal.\n");
else
 printf("Strings are not equal.\n");
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:
<img width="351" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1b20a3-23d6-48e8-92e3-c3e67a513273" />



## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
